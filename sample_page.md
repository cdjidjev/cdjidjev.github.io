## Towards Real-Time Monitoring of Public Opinion on Twitter Using Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

**Project description:** In my project, titled, I undertook the task of conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter data pertaining to specific topics. Initially, I faced obstacles on real-time streaming due to Twitter's access restrictions. Thankfully, after acquiring a Twitter bearer token, I enabled the successful execution of the code, which employed NLTK library tools for sentiment score prediction. As my research progressed, I incorporated NLP and machine learning techniques to enhance sentiment analysis. Utilizing Twitter's filtered streaming option, I collected data, focusing on topics such as "covid" and "chatGPT," and observed that COVID-19-related tweets exhibited more negative sentiment and emotions, while those about chatGPT skewed positive. 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

The project's primary hypothesis aimed to explore whether combining sentiment and emotion analysis could yield deeper insights into overall topic opinions. I selected two Twitter topics expected to exhibit predominantly negative and positive sentiments for investigation.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
